Wow. So I just walked out of Honeymoon Crasher and I'm... well, honestly, I'm still processing. It was kind of like one of those fairground rides where you're upside down before you even realize you've gotten on the thing. 

Popcorn everywhere. On me, not the floor. The movie theater was freezing, kinda like the inside of a freezer, and my back's gonna hate me tomorrow. But there were moments—oh man, there were pieces where time sort of folded in on itself like it was a lazy Sunday and the clocks went on strike.

> What was that scene with the flamingo? Just absurd. It drifted in like a confused dream sequence when all the flamingos took off, leaving behind a sort of eerie silence, only broken by the crunch of popcorn from my neighbor. Let's talk about the car chase scene! It was less Fast & Furious, more Fast & Forlorn, characters haphazardly fumbling, like toddlers playing with keys. There was this street that looked suspiciously like my Aunt Betty’s kitchen somehow. 

I kept thinking how it reminded me of one of those Renaissance paintings where there’s just way too much happening in one spot. So vivid, you start wondering if they put something in the popcorn butter, but more coherent than that old projector they had in history class. Remember you asked to download the movie? Might be better to watch it… or watch history unfold through a kaleidoscope of madness.

The whole narrative had this... centrifuge effect, you know? Like shaking a snow globe but instead of snow, it's tiny snippets of pure chaos. There was a poignant stare across a busy street—don’t even know why that hit me. Maybe I skipped too many meals. 

Anyway, I better stop before I turn this into a failed attempt at a novel. See it, don’t see it; either way, you'll end up talking about it with strangers.
